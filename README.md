learning and demonstration of Microsoft Azure skills 
during the [Future Ready Talent Program](https://futurereadytalent.in/). 

**Therefore, this project is not intended for commercial deployment.**

This project mainly focuses on algorithms and basics of data structure concepts.
It consists of complex iterations and functions. 
This quiz generally works on the data stored in the code. 
It is a single choice correct type questions quiz, and the score obtained is displayed at the end of a game.
The code implementation is in JavaScript and HTML programming languages, styled using CSS, giving it a presentable outlook.

**Aim:**

The main aim of creating this project on questionnaire on DSA is that this kind of system can be used in Schools/Colleges for conducting the Quizzes.
This project is designed in Java Script and HTML, and styled using CSS. As a part of the project different variables, functions and strings have been used. It will be very convenient and easy for the users to operate and understand.

And has a basic outlook, making it comfortable for new users to interact. The user wonâ€™t find it difficult to use and navigate. A progress bar indicates the fraction of questions done.



**Introduction:**

The project is implemented using JavaScript and HTML

**The possible future enhancement include:**

Adding multiple choice questions.
Storing data in more organized way in database.
